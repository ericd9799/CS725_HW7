# Final Visualization
![alt text](SmallMultiple.png)

The above visualization presents the comparision of percentage of population in rural areas of South American countries with access to basic drinking-water services and basic sanitation services. The blue line represents the population using basic sanitation services, and orange line represents the population using basic drinking-water services. The question the visualization answer is how does access to basic drinking-water services compare to basic sanitation services in rural areas of South American countries? 

From the visualization, we immediately see that a majority of the South American countries are closing the gap of population in rural areas having basic access to drinking-water services and sanitation services. This is because the trend of both measures are increasing each year. There is one country that is an outlier, Suriname. The access to basic drinking-water service seem to have plateau, but access to basic sanitation services is slowly declining. Most importantly, populations in rural area of Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay has equal access to both basic drinking-water services and sanitation services. We can also see that a majority of the countries started having access to basic drinking-water services before sanitation. With Uruguay being the outlier in the situation.

The visualization answers the posed question by displaying the trend of access to basic drinking-water services, and basic sanitation services in one graph for each country. Furthremore, we are able to compare between different South American countries because all the graphs are grouped together. The same color used to represent basic drinking-water service and basic sanitation service was used on all the graph to allow for comparison of one service amongst each country.
