The above presentation presents the percentage of population in rural areas of South American countries with access to basic drinking-water services and basic sanitation services. The blue line represents the population using basic sanitation services, and orange line represents the population using basic drinking-water services. The question the visualization answer is how does access to basic drinking-water services compare to basic sanitation services in rural areas of South American countries? From the graph, we can immediately see population in rural area in Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay has access to both basic drinking-water and sanitation services. We also see that in rural area in Suriname, access to basic drinking-water service seem to have plateau, but access to basic sanitation services is slowly declining. Out of all the countries, Suriname has a negative correlation.
