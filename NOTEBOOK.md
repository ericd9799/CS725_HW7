# Exploratory Analysis Process
Starting with the datasets and proposed questions from [Homework 5](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/ediep/CS725-HW5), I had to explore the dataset for each question to see which dataset and question was feasible to continue exploring.

The initial question is, how has the access to drinking water and sanitation changed over time for rural areas?

The dataset I am using for analysis is provided by World Health Organization. The dataset used are [basic and safely managed sanitation services data](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WSHSANITATION?lang=en), and [basic and safely managed drinking water services data](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WSHWATER?lang=en).

For the dataset, CSV files were provided and they were not formatted -- no borders, duplicate header columns. Thus, I had to format the files to allow for it to be easier to explore. Within the dataset, there are columns rating the country's access to basic services and managed services for both sanitation and drinking water services. Managed sanitation service is improved sanitation facility where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or treated off site. While basic sanitation service is improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households. Managed drinking water service is where drinking water is accessible on premises and free from faecal and chemal contamination. Basic drinking water service is where drinking water from an improved source where the population does not have to travel more than 30 minutes round-trip.
