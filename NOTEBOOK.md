# Exploratory Analysis Process
Starting with the datasets and proposed questions from [Homework 5](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/ediep/CS725-HW5), I had to explore the dataset for each question to see which dataset and question was feasible to continue exploring.

The initial question is, how has the access to drinking water and sanitation changed over time for rural areas?

The , thus I had to narrow it down to a few countries . To find a country to further explore its data, I filtered the data to remove those who had blanks or had ratings between 90 - 100. I also found myself having to further explore certain datasets to fully understand the data provided
