# Exploratory Analysis Process
Starting with the datasets and proposed questions from [Homework 5](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/ediep/CS725-HW5), I had to explore the dataset for each question to see which dataset and question was feasible to continue exploring.

The initial question is, does a country's hygiene rating correlate to having access to drinking water and sanitation?

Many countries are accounted for in the dataset, thus I had to narrow it down to one country to allow for a more manageable analysis. To find a country to further explore its data, I filtered the data to remove those who had blanks or had ratings between 90 - 100. I also found myself having to further explore certain datasets to fully understand the data provided
