# Exploratory Analysis Process
Starting with the datasets and proposed questions from [Homework 5](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/ediep/CS725-HW5), I had to explore the dataset for each question to see which dataset and question was feasible to continue exploring.

The initial question is, how has the access to drinking water and sanitation changed over time for rural areas?

The dataset I am using for analysis is provided by World Health Organization. The dataset used are [basic and safely managed sanitation services data](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WSHSANITATION?lang=en), and [basic and safely managed drinking water services data](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WSHWATER?lang=en).

For the dataset, they were CSV files that were not formatted. Thus, I had to format the files to allow for it to be easier to explore. Within the dataset, there are columns rating the country's access to basic services and managed services; I had to look-up the definition of the columns to know if they are different.
